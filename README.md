# Abstract
In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework justifying the existence of a correlation risk premium in a market with two traded assets. We provide a theoretical framework justifying the existence of a cor- relation risk premium in a market with two traded assets. We prove that risk-neutral dependence can differ substantially from real-world dependence by characterizing the set of risk-neutral martingale measures. This implies that implied correlation can be significantly different with the realized correlation. Depending on the choice of the market regarding the pricing measure, implied correlation can be high or low. We label the difference between risk-neutral and real-world correlation the ‘corre- lation gap’ and make the connection with correlation risk premium. We show how dispersion trading can be used to exploit this correlation gap and demonstrate how there can exist a negative correlation risk premium in the financial market. 

# Discription
**Multi-period_Correlation_Gap.py:**
1. This script can be used to reproduce the numerical results in Section 3.3.
2. The code can also be used to calculate realized correlations and implied correlations, as well as realized volatilities and implied volatilities, when the stock prices follow binomial tree models.
3. 
**Simulation_Payoff_DispersionSwap.py:**
1. This script can be used to reproduce the simulation results in Section 6.
2. This code can also be used to simulate the payoff of dispersion swap when the stock prices follow binomial tree models.
